## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete Alice Pauline`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonDetailPanel`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete Alice Pauline")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete Alice Pauline` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model Component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the company book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' (e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes).
* stores the currently 'focused' `Person` objects (e.g., target of view detail command) as a separate _focused_ person which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `SimpleObjectProperty<Person>` that can be 'observed' (e.g. the UI can be bound to this object so that the UI automatically updates when the focus person changes).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a `CommandHistory` object that keeps track of the commands a user inputs during runtime. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyCommandHistory` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both company book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.company.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Sort Feature

Sorting is facilitated by `SortCommand` and `SortCommandParser`, following these steps:

1. **User input parsing**: `SortCommandParser#parse()` tokenizes the user input into an `ArgumentMultimap` containing the field and order values, then validates the tokens and creates a `SortCommand` object with the parsed parameters.

2. **Comparator Creation**: `SortCommand#execute()` calls `SortCommand#getComparator()` which creates the appropriate `Comparator<Person>` based on the specified field (name/tag) and order (ascending/descending).

3. **Model update**: `SortCommand` invokes `Model#sortPersons(comparator)` to trigger the sorting operation.

4. **Sorting execution**: The sort operation cascades through:
    * `Model#sortPersons(comparator)` &rarr; `AddressBook#sortPersons(comparator)` &rarr; `UniquePersonList#sortPersons(comparator)`

5. **Result**: A `CommandResult` is returned to display the success message to the user.

The sequence diagram below shows how the sort operation works:
<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

The activity diagram below depicts the execution flow of the sort command:
<puml src="diagrams/SortActivityDiagram.puml" width="100%" />


### Filter Feature
The filtering mechanism is facilitated by `FilterCommand` and `FilterCommandParser`, following these steps:

1. **User input parsing**: `FilterCommandParser#parse()` tokenizes the user input into an `ArgumentMultimap` containing tag values, then validates the tokens through `FilterCommandParser#checkValidTokens()`. The parser converts all tags to lowercase, removes duplicates, and creates a `TagsContainTagPredicate` object with the processed tags. A `FilterCommand` object is then instantiated with this predicate.

2. **Validation checks**: The parser performs several validations:
    * Ensures that at least one `PREFIX_TAG` token exists
    * Verifies no input exists between "filter" and the first prefix
    * Confirms no empty tags are present
    * Validates all tag names are alphanumeric and at most 30 characters

3. **Model update**: `FilterCommand#execute()` invokes `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` to apply the filtering operation.

4. **Filtering execution**: The model updates its filtered contact list by applying the `TagsContainTagPredicate`, which matches any contact whose tags contain at least one of the specified tags (case-insensitive matching).

5. **Result**: A `CommandResult` is returned to display the success message to the user. The success message contains the number of contacts found that match the filter criteria.

The sequence diagram below shows how the filter operation works:
<puml src="diagrams/FilterSequenceDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

The activity diagram below depicts the execution flow of the filter command:
<puml src="diagrams/FilterActivityDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

### Delete Feature
Deleting contacts is facilitated by `DeleteCommand` and `DeleteCommandParser`, following these steps:

1. **User input parsing**: `DeleteCommandParser#parse()` trims the user input and first attempts to interpret it as an index
   via `ParserUtil.parseIndex()`. If parsing the index fails, it falls back to `ParserUtil.parseName()` to treat the argument as
   a name, throwing a `ParseException` if both attempts fail.

2. **Target resolution**: The resulting `DeleteCommand` records whether it will operate on an index or a name and, during
   execution, routes to the corresponding helper (`executeDeleteByIndex` or `executeDeleteByName`).

3. **Model lookup**: For index-based deletes, the command retrieves the target from `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` and ensures
   the index is within bounds. For name-based deletes, it scans `Model#getAddressBook().getPersonList()` for case-insensitive
   matches to the provided name.

4. **Disambiguation**: If multiple contacts share the same name, the command updates the filtered list through
   `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(...)` so the UI displays only the matching entries, then prompts the user to delete the
   intended contact by index.

5. **Deletion and feedback**: Once a single target is identified, `Model#deletePerson(person)` removes it from storage, and the
   command returns a `CommandResult` summarizing the deleted contact.

The sequence diagram below shows how the filter operation works:
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

The activity diagram below depicts the execution flow of the filter command:
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteActivityDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

### Edit Feature
Editing contacts is facilitated by `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser`, following these steps:

1. **User input parsing**: `EditCommandParser#parse()` tokenizes the user input into an `ArgumentMultimap` containing the target identifier (index or name) and field values to update. The parser first attempts to interpret the preamble as an index via `ParserUtil.parseIndex()`. If parsing fails, it treats the preamble as a name reference.

2. **Validation checks**: The parser performs several validations:
   * Ensures that at least one field to edit is provided
   * Verifies no duplicate prefixes for singular fields (name, phone, email, company, detail)
   * Checks that `PREFIX_TAG` (overwrite) is not used together with `PREFIX_TAG_ADD` or `PREFIX_TAG_DELETE`
   * Validates that tags to add or delete are not empty

3. **Target resolution**: During execution, `EditCommand#execute()` determines whether to operate on an index or a name:
   * For index-based edits, the command retrieves the target from `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` and ensures the index is within bounds.
   * For name-based edits, it normalizes the name (case-insensitive, multiple spaces collapsed) and scans the filtered list for matches.

4. **Disambiguation**: If multiple contacts share the same name, the command updates the filtered list through `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(...)` to display only matching entries, then prompts the user to edit by index instead.

5. **Tag handling**: The edit command supports three tag modification modes:
   * **Overwrite mode** (`t/`): Replaces all existing tags with the specified tags
   * **Addition mode** (`t+/`): Adds specified tags to existing tags
   * **Deletion mode** (`t-/`): Removes specified tags from existing tags (validates that tags exist before deletion)

6. **Person creation and validation**: The command creates an edited person through `createEditedPerson()`, which applies all field updates including tag modifications. It then validates:
   * The edited person is not a duplicate of another existing contact
   * The edited email (if changed) is not used by another contact
   * All tags to be deleted actually exist on the person

7. **Model update and feedback**: Once validation passes, `Model#setPerson(personToEdit, editedPerson)` replaces the original person with the edited version. The filtered list is updated to show only the edited contact, and a `CommandResult` is returned with the success message displaying the updated contact details.

The sequence diagram below shows how the edit operation works:
<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

### Command Recall Feature
The repeat mechanism is facilitated by `CommandHistory` Model and `LogicManager`.

The Sequence diagram for a `getPreviousCommand` Operation:
Sequence is similar for `getNextCommand` but in reverse.

1. **Key Pressed**: `CommandBox` handles the event with a call to `navigateCommandHistory(x)` with `x` being '-1' for previous command, and `1' for next command in history.

2. **Command Bubbles Down**: A series of function calls are then passed through the Logic Component and the Model Component

3. **Get Last Nth Command**: `CommandHistory` gets the last nth command based on its current value of `currCommandIndex` and returns the respective string value of the command saved in history. Subsequently, `currCommandIndex` is incremented till `n` (where `n` is the current size of the history list)

4. **Update CommandBox**: Target Command String gets returned back and `CommandBox` updates its text field to show the command, along with setting the cursor to end of line.

<puml src="diagrams/CommandHistoryDiagram.puml" width="100%" />


### Add Contact with Basic Information
The add operation is facilitated by the `AddCommandBasic` class within the Logic and Model components.

The Sequence diagram for an **Add Basic Command** operation is shown below.

1. **User Input**: The user enters the command `addbasic n/NAME p/PHONE` in the `CommandBox` (e.g., `addbasic n/Jadon p/88880000`).

2. **Command Parsing and Execution**:  
   The input is passed from the `CommandBox` to the `MainWindow`, which then invokes the `LogicManager` to execute the command.  
   `LogicManager` constructs an `AddCommandBasic` object with a `Person` instance containing the specified name and phone number.

3. **Model Update**:  
   The `AddCommandBasic` checks through the `ModelManager` to verify if the contact already exists.  
   If not found, the new contact is added to the model and stored in memory.

4. **Success Message**:  
   Upon successful addition, `Messages.format()` is called to format the result, and a `CommandResult` is returned to `LogicManager`.  
   The `MainWindow` then updates the UI to display the success message in the `CommandBox`.

<puml src="diagrams/AddCommandBasicDiagram.puml" width="100%" />
<puml src="diagrams/AddCommandBasicActivityDiagram.puml" width="100%" />


### Add Contact with Full Information

The **add** operation is facilitated by the `AddCommand` class within the **Logic** and **Model** components.

1. **User Input**
   The user enters the command:

   ```
   add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL c/COMPANY [t/TAG]...
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   add n/Alice p/88889999 e/alice@example.com c/NUS t/friend
   ```

2. **Command Parsing and Execution**
   The command string is passed from the `CommandBox` to the `MainWindow`, which forwards it to the `LogicManager` for execution.
   The `LogicManager` then constructs an `AddCommand` object with a `Person` instance containing the specified details (`name`, `phone`, `email`, `company`, and optional `tags`).

3. **Validation and Model Update**
   The `AddCommand` performs a comprehensive validation process:

    * Checks whether the **command format** is valid and any **required fields** (`n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `c/`) are missing.
    * Checks whether **field values** are valid (e.g., name and company character rules, valid email syntax, phone number format, valid tags).
    * Checks whether a **duplicate person** (same name and phone) already exists.
    * Checks whether the **email** already exists in another contact.

   If a validation error or duplicate is detected, the corresponding error message is returned to the UI.
   Otherwise, the new person is added to the `ModelManager`, updating the in-memory address book.

4. **Storage Update**
   The `LogicManager` calls `saveAddressBook(addressBook)` in the **Storage** component, which serializes and writes the updated address book data to the local storage file.

5. **Result Display**
   Upon successful addition, a `CommandResult` is created with a formatted success message (via `Messages.format()`),
   and returned through the `LogicManager` back to the `MainWindow`, which updates the UI to display the message.
